# antToRewriteHtmlContent
POC project to check how ANT can be used to re-write the content in HTML/JSP files. In production applications JS files are minified and merged to bring high performance. This is to check how those changes to JS files can reflect in reference HTML/JSP files during the build process. 

Note : For minify, merged and sourcemap can consider something like google closure-compiler
